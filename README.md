For this project I am interested in analyzing the Airbnb Boston data
and I will be trying to answer some questions to help us understand the effect of rooms 
neighbourhood and other variables on the price of rooms.
the questions are as follows:

1) What neighbourhood has the most listings?

2) How does the canellation policy affect the price and what is the most common one?

3) How does the number of rooms affect the price?

4) What season is the busiest one?

5) What are good indicators of salary?

There is one ipynb file containing the whole analysis plus 3 csv files for the raw input data.
inside the ipynb file you will find a detailed description and comments of the analysis
process.

Must give credit to Airbnb for providing this data for use it is available on this link:
